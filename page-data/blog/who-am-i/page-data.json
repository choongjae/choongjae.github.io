When I was in elementary school, I remember\\nbeing oddly fascinated with potatoes, and I always dreamed about getting the potato.com\\ndomain and just playing around with it. I didn't really ever have a goal in mind, other\\nthan to make it potato-related. But aside from that goal, I thought that building a\\npersonal website would be good for 3 more reasons: branding and marketing myself professionally,\\nfurther developing my web development skills, and writing this blog.

But most of all, I've also always wanted to set up my personal blog to\\nreally solidify my own place on the Internet.

I've definitely grown a deeper appreciation for philosophy (although\\nI admit that I've yet to take a corresponding class at Cornell), and I've realized that\\nI need to do better in recording my thoughts and conclusions so that I can build on\\nmy thinking, rather than incubating haphazard and repetitive thoughts.
